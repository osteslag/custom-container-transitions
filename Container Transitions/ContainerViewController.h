/** A very simple container view controller for demonstrating containment in an environment different from UINavigationController and UITabBarController.
 @discussion This class implements support for non-interactive custom view controller transitions.
 @note One of the many current limitations, besides not supporting interactive transitions, is that you cannot change view controllers after the object has been initialized.
